# prnt.sc/lightshot scrapper
THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES, 
I WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR ACTIONS.

## Purpose
To show the extreme security flaw that this site has, this is not going to be used malicously or at all, i have no interest in scrapping the website, just posting because i found it interesting.

## Explanation
Lightshots method of storing images is awful, to find literally anyones image that posted their screenshot to the cloud just type the url https://prnt.sc/ + 2 random letters + 4 numbers (ex. https://prnt.sc/ab1234) and it will take you to a site containing a users screenshot, if it has not been removed.

## Warning
Depending on the speed you send requests, you will most likely get banned, i was downloading around ~10 images a second and my ip got banned by cloudflare, which shows they have 'some' protection. Obviously you could easily get around it considering its only cloudflare.
